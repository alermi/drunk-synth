# drunk-synth
Mus 176 Final Project

This project is a "drunk" synth for STM32F4 Discovery, based off of code by Tom Erbe. This can be used by connecting a midi keyboard to the STM32F4.

The "drunk" synth works by taking a square waveform and modulating each harmonic's volume by a random small step periodically.
